Face and Hand Tracking:


This project is a Python application that utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform real-time face and hand tracking.
The application also integrates PyCaw to control the system's audio volume based on hand gestures.

Features

-Hand Tracking: Tracks hand movements, landmarks, and distances between fingers.
-Volume Control: Adjusts system volume based on the distance between the thumb and pinky fingers.
-Face Tracking: Detects and tracks facial landmarks using MediaPipe, with optional features for additional processing.
-Real-Time Processing: Processes frames from a webcam feed, providing real-time feedback on hand and face movements.

Technologies

-Python 3.11
-OpenCV: For computer vision tasks.
-MediaPipe: For hand and face tracking.
-PyCaw: For volume control.
-Comtypes: Required for PyCaw.
